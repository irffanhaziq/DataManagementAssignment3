# Iris : Classification Using Spark MLlib

## Project Summary

This project involves the classification tasks on the Iris dataset using Spark MLlib. The key steps covered in this project include:

1. Loading the Iris dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
2. Dividing the dataset into training and test subsets.
3. Selecting a classifier, specifically the Random Forest classifier.
4. Fine-tuning hyperparameters with the help of cross-validation and grid search.
5. Calculating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Generating predictions on testing data.
7. Comparing predicted labels against the actual labels to determine model performance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 instances, each with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one of three class labels (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
